# HotkeyLearning
AHK script that will prompt you with a question from a customizable file at a specified time interval on your desktop.

THis is an expansion of my vocab flashcard script with more functionality. This program allows you to set up multiple topics of questions/answers. The questions can include pictures. The time in between the questions can be adjusted. A GUI was implemented to select question set and time interval.

Great for studying while on your computer. Included are my files for learning vocab and tree identification.
